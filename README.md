## DTO UI-Kit Bootstrap Theme

An ever evolving drop-in Bootstrap v3 stylesheet in the style of the Australian Government [DTO Design Guide &amp; UI-Kit](https://gov-au-ui-kit.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/).


To use the look of [all their components](http://gov-au-ui-kit.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/examples/all.html)

Using Boostrap classes where ever possible, with a small number of extra classes to use some elements which had no Bootstrap equivalent.

*Currently just compiling Sass via CodeKit (v3).*

*Will use Gulp when added into actual theme - such as [test.Directory](https://test.directory.gov.au/) and [govstrap theme](https://github.com/govCMS/govstrap)*
